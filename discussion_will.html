      <p>The atoms in our bodies behave according to the laws of physics. If we had a sufficiently powerful supercomputer, it could simulate the future behavior of the atoms that make up our bodies, therefore predicting our every future move.</p>

        <p>In order to predict how a hydrogen atom will behave, you'll have to predict how things smaller than atoms behave -- electrons, photons, quarks and other quanta. These particles behave in ways that are stochastic, or non-determined.</p>
